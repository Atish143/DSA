Hello LinkedIn! 👋

🚀 Day 11 of My #100DaysOfDSA Journey! 🚀





Today, I explored Binary Search – a much faster searching algorithm than Linear Search! 🔍





📌 What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient searching technique that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space into half until it finds the target.





🔹 Example:

Imagine searching for a word in a dictionary 📖. You don’t check every word one by one. Instead, you open the middle, compare, and move left or right accordingly.







🛠️ Binary Search in JavaScript

function BinarySearch(array, target) {

    let leftIndex = 0;

    let rightIndex = array.length - 1;

    while (leftIndex <= rightIndex) {

        let middleIndex = Math.floor((leftIndex + rightIndex) / 2);

        console.log('middleIndex:', middleIndex);

        if (target === array[middleIndex]) {

            return middleIndex;  // Target found

        }

        if (target < array[middleIndex]) {

            rightIndex = middleIndex - 1;  // Search in left half

        } else {

            leftIndex = middleIndex + 1;  // Search in right half

        }

    }

    return -1;  // Target not found

}

console.log(BinarySearch([-2, 10, 18, 25, 30, 40], 25)); // Output: 3







🧐 How Does This Work? (Step-by-Step Example)

For array = [-2, 10, 18, 25, 30, 40] and target = 25:

 1️⃣ Find the middle → (0 + 5) / 2 = 2 → array[2] = 18 (not 25)

 2️⃣ Since 25 > 18, search right half (index 3 to 5)

 3️⃣ New middle → (3 + 5) / 2 = 4 → array[4] = 30 (not 25)

 4️⃣ Since 25 < 30, search left half (index 3)

 5️⃣ array[3] = 25 ✅ Found! Returns index 3







⏳ Understanding Time Complexity

🔹 Worst Case: O(log n) – With each step, we eliminate half the elements.

🔹 Best Case: O(1) – If the middle element is the target.

💡 Binary Search is much faster than Linear Search for large datasets!







💡 Key Takeaways

✔ Works only on sorted arrays.

✔ More efficient than Linear Search (O(n)).

✔ Reduces search space by half each time (O(log n)).





Binary Search is a must-know for every developer! 🚀
