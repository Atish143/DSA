🚀 Day 15 of My #100DaysOfDSA Journey! 🚀
Hello LinkedIn! 👋

Today, I explored Quick Sort, one of the most efficient sorting algorithms! ⚡

📌 What is Quick Sort?
Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two parts:
🔹 Left Subarray → Elements smaller than the pivot
🔹 Right Subarray → Elements greater than the pivot
It then recursively sorts both subarrays and combines them!

🛠️ Quick Sort in JavaScript

function quickSort(array) {
    if (array.length < 2) {
        return array; // Base case
    }

    let pivot = array[array.length - 1]; // Choosing the last element as pivot
    let left = [];
    let right = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
        if (array[i] < pivot) {
            left.push(array[i]); // Elements smaller than pivot
        } else {
            right.push(array[i]); // Elements greater than pivot
        }
    }

    return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}

const arr = [999, 45, -54, 549, -7, 75];
console.log(quickSort(arr));  
// Output: [-54, -7, 45, 75, 549, 999]
🧐 How Does Quick Sort Work? (Step-by-Step Example)
For array = [5, 3, 8, 1] with pivot = 1

1️⃣ Partition → Left [ ], Pivot 1, Right [5, 3, 8]
2️⃣ Recursive sort → Left remains empty, Right [5, 3, 8] → Pivot = 8
3️⃣ New Left [5, 3], Pivot 8, Right [ ]
4️⃣ Recursive sort → [3, 5] sorted
✅ Final Output: [1, 3, 5, 8]

⏳ Understanding Time Complexity
🔹 Best & Average Case: O(n log n) – Efficient for large datasets.
🔹 Worst Case: O(n²) – If the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (can be optimized).

💡 Quick Sort is widely used due to its efficiency and in-place sorting capability!

💡 Key Takeaways
✔ Faster than Bubble & Insertion Sort for large datasets
✔ Uses divide and conquer for better efficiency
✔ Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the average case
✔ Not a stable sort (doesn’t maintain relative order of equal elements)
